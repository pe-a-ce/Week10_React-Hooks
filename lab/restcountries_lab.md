# React 

## RESTCountries Exercise

This task is going to look pretty familiar. We saw the RESTCountries API previously within the JavaScript `fetch()` lab. We're going to be revisiting it here, touching on some of the same topics, but this time with our fancy new React tools under our belt. 

Again, the API we are asking you to utilise is the **RESTCountries API** which returns information about a selected country including *e.g.* the name of the capital city, the local currency, its (continental) region and a link to the relevant Google Maps page.

## Lab Task

You will be working in pairs and will be building a **country bucket list**, combining the classic To-Do List example with novel data. The API affords great possibilities in regard to visual presentation so we are leaving the specifications for the projects fairly loose. In general, each group should:

- Interface with the RESTcountries API, loading the data into your app
- Save the loaded data using React's State management system
- Present the user with a list of countries which they can select from
- Create a means to mark a country as "visited"
- Additionally display a list of "visited countries"

## Extensions

There are a few extension tasks for this exercise. Note that all are extensible so we are not expecting all to be completed within the afternoon, if any:

- Have a way to display more specific details of a selected country
- Implement a means to filter the countries within the initial list, akin to how we did within the original JavaScript exercise (an HTML form)
- See what properties are returned from the API which you can make use of for styling your webpage in some way

It is up to you how you design and implement this feature. Because we have left the design and largely the implementation of functionality loose for this lab, do attempt to work your way through the points set out above but also *feel free to experiment and work in other areas that you feel you need practise with*. 

## Tips

You may find that the use of a JSON formatter will help significantly when getting to grips with the data the API returns.

*e.g.* [JSON formatter - JSON Pretty Print](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print)

**Communication is key** so if you do work individually at any point then please do make sure to communicate with your team where it is you're working. Keeping regular contact will ensure that your project runs smoothly and bettering these skills of project management will set you up well for any future roles.

The primary aim for this project is to afford you time to work on your **Front-end / React knowledge** ahead of the main Client-Side Project. Our secondary aim is for you to further add to your **online portfolio** which you can present within any future interview processes. With this, we suggest that you spend some time together as a team putting together a cohesive vision for your app. **Take some time to visually plan your app** before you jump into the code. We suggest using with Miro or Figma for creating a wireframe of your site but Microsoft Powerpoint (or equivalent) or simple pen and paper will work just as well at this stage.
